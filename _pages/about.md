Hi! I‚Äôm **Betul Ozturan**, a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at **Boston College**, where I study how rebel groups evolve into political actors, and how power-sharing institutions emerge in post-conflict societies. My work sits at the intersection of international relations, comparative politics, and political violence‚Äîasking questions like: When does armed conflict give way to democracy? Why do some rebel groups gain legitimacy while others don‚Äôt? How do alliances during war shape the political institutions that follow?

My dissertation project investigates **rebel group alliances** and their long-term influence on postwar governance. To do this, I combine computational methods‚Äîlike **text analysis**, **social network analysis**, and **event data modeling** with case studies in places like Bosnia and Syria. I also work with large datasets on political violence, often building tools that help researchers and the public better understand conflict dynamics.

What is going on? 
======
My most recent publication, *‚ÄúHow Students and the Public Define Terrorism, and How Education Affects Those Definitions‚Äù*, was published in the **Terrorism & Political Violence** (2025).

I will be presenting my research on rebel relations at **IC2S2 July 23, 2025 (virtual)**, **PolNet 2025 at Harvard****, **APSA 2025 (virtual)**, and **CRS 2025 (in Kent, UK)**. 

I have completed **Network Analysis I** and **Data visualization** courses at ICPSR, and currently studying **Network Analysis II** with the support of EITM scholarship. 

I have published a research essay ‚Äù**From conflict to consensus: Power-sharing and the path to
democracy**‚Äù on Clough Center Journal 2025. 


Education
======

Before starting my Ph.D. in the U.S., I completed a **double M.A.** in *International Security Studies* from **Charles University** in Prague, and another in *Political Science and Public Administration* from the **University of Konstanz** in Germany. My master‚Äôs thesis introduced the **POLVITED dataset**‚Äîa merged conflict event database for T√ºrkiye‚Äîwhere I applied **machine learning** and **spatial visualization** to track patterns in political violence. I also participated in the **ICPSR Summer Program** at the University of Michigan and the **Summer Institute in Computational Social Science (SICSS)**.

I hold a B.A. in **Political Science and International Relations** from **Boƒüazi√ßi University** in Istanbul, where I also minored in Economics and spent a semester at **The American University in Cairo** as an exchange student.


Teaching
======

Over the past four years, I‚Äôve taught and assisted in a range of undergraduate courses, including:

- *Introduction to International Relations* (2024, 2025)
- *Global Governance* (2023)
- *Internet and Politics* (2022)
- *Introduction to Turkish Politics* (2017)
- *Python for Social and Economic Data Science* (2019)


## Other things I do

In addition to my dissertation work, I‚Äôve conducted field research in **Ukraine**, worked on projects like the **Political Violence Lab** and **Western Jihadism Project**, and presented at major conferences including **APSA**, **ISA**, and **MPSA**. I‚Äôve also been fortunate to receive fellowships and support from the **Clough Center for the Study of Constitutional Democracy**, and the **German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)**.
